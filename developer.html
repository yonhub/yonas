        Web Development 101: How Do Websites Work?
       </h1>
       <p>
        At the most basic level, websites are collections of files and code stored on a server, which is connected to the internet. You access a website by loading it through a browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari), also known as the client. This pair constitutes the “server-client model.”

        Let’s consider how this works in action: let’s say your friend sends you a link to a funny video. When you click on the link, your web browser (the client) sends a request to the video website (the server) asking for the video file. The website’s server receives the request and sends the file to your computer. 
        
        The client-side and server-side are referred to as the “front end” and the “back end,” respectively. Front end web developers focus on a website’s client-side functions, while back end web developers focus on a website’s server-side development. Full stack developers work with just that — the “full stack” of development technologies — and have mastery of both front and back end technologies. 
        
        Understanding the differences between each can help you decide which of the three you would like to specialize in during your career. Now, let’s cover the differences between front end, back end and full stack web development. 
       </p>
       <h1>
        HTML 
       </h1>
       <p>
        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) allows coders to define a website’s basic structure and design. An HTML file tells a browser what to display on a device’s screen and how elements like paragraphs, lists and images are arranged. 

        HTML is very accessible and can provide an excellent introduction for people who are new to coding. It’s a critical part of a web developer’s toolkit and acts as a jumping-off point for all websites. Modern websites utilize powerful scripting languages like JavaScript to create dynamic web content. However, even though it’s a much older technology, HTML is still at the core of these websites. 
        
        Want more information on this “building block” coding language? Here’s a guide to learning HTML.
       </p>
       <h1>
        CSS
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) changes how HTML elements are displayed on a screen. Understanding CSS allows you to create great looking web pages across all major browsers. You can change a page’s layout, colors and fonts, as well as add effects to page elements. 

        CSS is used in combination with HTML to create and style web pages. It’s easy to learn and understand, but it also has a lot of depth. CSS gives you a lot of control over how an HTML document is presented to the user — as such, learning CSS is crucial for anyone looking to create beautiful and responsive websites. 

    </p>
    <h1>
        JavaScript
    </h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is another critical component in a front end web developer’s toolbox. It’s one of the most popular languages on the market according to HackerRank’s 2020 Developer report (PDF, 2.8MB), and the #1 most requested language by hiring managers.

        JavaScript is a client-side language that is used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic, responsive websites. It’s easy to pick up and incredibly versatile, allowing a developer to handle any part of a website’s design and functionality. Many of the skills involved with writing JavaScript can also be applied to other languages like Python and Java, making it an excellent introduction to coding. 
        
        Learning JavaScript is essential for anyone who wants to work as a full stack or front end web developer. Check out our JavaScript for beginners guide for more information and ways to learn this crucial language.

        <h1>Tips to Consider</h1>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Define your goals: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Jumping into the deep end of web development can feel overwhelming if you don’t have a plan. Think about what you want to learn and map out a timeline to achieve your goals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Go beyond tutorials: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the best ways to learn is to put what you know into practice — tutorials won’t turn you into a developer overnight. Making real-world websites is critical for your learning.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Take a bootcamp or class: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s a lot to learn when it comes to web development. Enrolling in a coding bootcamp focused on web development can help you structure your learning over a condensed period of time so you can start building websites quickly.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Never stop learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: The web is constantly changing — so, naturally, web best practices are too. Something you learn today might not be the standard in five years, so you should always have a learning mindset.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Put together a portfolio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Creating a portfolio gives you something to show employers once you begin your job search. Keep track of your projects and showcase them to the world.&nbsp;</span></li>
